Goal: 4 Dry Out e-Rental GUI is designed to allow customers coming to the website the option to choose from 5 various kinds of water damage equipment. 
Once the user chooses, they are taken to a separate page including a body of information about the unit, pricing, a picture, and check boxes to 
pick which kind they want to add to the order. It should compile the chosen equipment into a customer order and allow the user to exit when complete.
